A five-stage pipelined processor that supports a modified version of the MIPS ISA. 

* CP4_processor_sj166 is the processor module
* This project includes an ALU, multiplier, divider, register file, and other sub-components used in the processor
* All modules in this project were designed by me as part of the ECE 350 course at Duke University
